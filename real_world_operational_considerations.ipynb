    "The pump is powered up to a lower pressure state and then held for a period of time. Then the pressure is bled off before going to a higher pressure state and held for a period of time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a typical preliminary step to check that the pump is operating correctly and that there are no unexpected leaks in the system.  \n",
